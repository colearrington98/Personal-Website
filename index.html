      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
        <p> 
          Hello, I am Cole Thompson Arrington. I was born in Charlottesvile, Virginia and grew up in Clarskville, TN.
        </p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated High School in 2016 from Aaron Academy, a Homeschool-program that allowed flexibilty and helped me graduate one year early.
          I then attended Nashville State Community College where I studied English for 2.5 years.
          Although I didn't finish my degree, I do plan on finishing my bachelors within the next 2 years.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Software Development?</h2>
          <p>
          A couple of years ago when I moved to Denver. I starting thinking of Career Paths. At the time I was doing pest control slowly working 
          on my pursuing my pilot's licence. Like flying, I always thought Software and Coding were for really smart gifted kids. But then started 
          to learn the basics of what Software developers did and the basics and fell in love with the possibilites. That sent me on the path to taking
          coding courses and attending a Full Stack Bootcamp at Vanderbilt. 
          </p>
          <h2>More About Me</h2>
          <P> I lived in Talkeetna, Alaska for a litte under a year working for a non profit camp. It was a great chance to give back to the community there while also
            getting to do fun projects and learn programs. 

            I am a musician and have been playing guitar since I was 9 and played and studied percussion until the end of High School.

            I am also working on my pilot's licence.
          </P>
